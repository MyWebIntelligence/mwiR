}
\arguments{

\item{land_name}{A character string specifying the name of the land (dataset or domain) from which media data will be exported. This helps filter the relevant subset of data.}

\item{minimum_relevance}{A numeric value specifying the minimum relevance score threshold. Only media entries with a relevance score equal to or above this threshold will be included in the export. This allows focusing on the most significant media related to expressions.}

\item{filename}{A character string specifying the name (and path) of the output CSV file where the exported media data will be saved.}
}
