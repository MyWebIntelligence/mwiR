\title{Export Domain Node Data to CSV with Relevance Filtering}
\usage{
export_nodecsv(con, land_name, minimum_relevance, filename)
}
\arguments{
\item{con}{A database connection object. This connection is used to access the database containing domain and expression data.}

\item{land_name}{A character string specifying the name of the land (dataset or domain) from which node data will be exported. This helps filter the relevant subset of data.}

\item{minimum_relevance}{A numeric value specifying the minimum relevance score threshold. Only nodes with an average relevance score equal to or above this threshold will be included in the export. This allows focusing on the most significant nodes.}

\item{filename}{A character string specifying the name (and path) of the output CSV file where the exported node data will be saved.}
}
\value{
Returns an integer indicating the number of rows successfully written to the CSV file. This helps verify the amount of data exported.
}
\description{
This function exports domain node data from a specified land (dataset) to a CSV file. The exported data includes the number of expressions associated with each node and their average relevance scores. The function filters nodes based on a minimum relevance score threshold, ensuring that only nodes meeting the relevance criteria are included. This is useful for extracting focused domain data for further analysis or reporting.
