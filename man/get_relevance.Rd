\item{weight}{A numeric value representing the weight or importance assigned to the relevance calculation. This can adjust the influence of the relevance score.}

\item{dictionary}{A character vector of terms that serve as the reference for calculating relevance. These terms are used to assess how closely the text matches the desired concepts.}

\item{language}{A character string specifying the language used for stemming and text processing. The default is "fr" (French), which affects how words are reduced to their root forms for comparison.}
}

}
\description{
This function computes relevance scores for a given text by comparing it against a provided dictionary of terms. The weight parameter allows adjusting the impact of the relevance calculation. The language parameter controls the stemming process, which reduces words to their base forms to improve matching accuracy. These relevance scores can be used for filtering, ranking, or further analysis of text data.
